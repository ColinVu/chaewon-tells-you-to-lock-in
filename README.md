## About This Project

she's really concerned for your wellbeing. you stopped talking to your friends and just send them cursed reels all day

---

## Features
- detects when selected social media apps are in use
- sends a push notification when the social media apps are used for 15 minutes consecutively
- when the push notif is pressed, a video pops up with chaewon telling you to lock in

---

# Planned Features
- idk i probably want to make a screen so you can change the amount of time you spend
- sometimes when you're scrolling you press on links that go to other pages and that resets the timer so maybe making the timer decrease rather than being set to 0 when you're on other pages helps. that way if you're only off for like 5 seconds the timer only goes down 5 seconds

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/ColinVu/chaewon-tells-you-to-lock-in
open the socialmedianotifier folder in android studio
voila chaewon is coming to save your soul and your productivity
